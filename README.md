# AWS Automation

## The Vision

1. Callibrity employees will be able to login to a UI to request an AWS account. 
    - A notification will be sent to management for approval
    - Upon receiving approval, the account will be created under the master billing account as part of the Callibrity Organization
    - The account will be created with a standardized (TBD) set of roles and other infrastructure
2. Callibrity employees will signin to the AWS console or API using GSuite as the identity providers
